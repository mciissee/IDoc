The plugin is fully integrated with Unity Editor thanks to an editor window that allow to set up a project and build the documentation.  

**WHY USE IDoc? ?**  
Developing proper documentation, particularly for complex project is normally a time consuming, costly and skills intensive task.  
Documentation during development can be considered as an optional task for developers. Developers often have the tendency to start documenting their project at the end of development, which can leave most projects poorly documented.  
With IDoc, documentation can be automatically produced throughout design and development without requiring investment or developer resources, providing development teams with an accurate and up to date reference and allowing new developers to jump the learning curve of new components and schemas.  
IDoc makes producing documentation a natural and productive activity for developers and technical writers alike.
